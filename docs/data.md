# Data Collection and Generation

The fulfillment systems presented in our paper are inspired by practical problems: experiment 1 (fulfillment of physical and virtual orders in one system) originates from Cainiao's domestic fulfillment business and experiment 2 (cross-border order fulfillment) stems from the fulfillment business of AliExpress.
Due to data disclosure regulation of the company, synthetic data is used for demonstration, which can be found in [exp1](env/define_exp1_env.py) and [exp2](env/define_exp2_env.py).
